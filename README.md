# university_courses
A repository to host my code-based projects from the University of Toronto's Engineering Science program.

## Introduction to Robotics (ROB301)
_Taught by Professor Nicholas Rhinehart._ 

- **[Automated Mail Delivery Robot](introduction_to_robotics):** Partial code for a control system to simulate mail delivery using a mobile robot, leveraging Bayesian localization, PID control, visual odometry, and other techniques.

## Computer Algorithms and Data Structures (ESC190)
_Taught by Professor Michael Guerzhoy._ 

The following projects were made in C.
- **[Autocomplete](data_structures_and_computer_algorithms/autocomplete):** An implementation of the autocomplete functionality, which sorts a file of terms by lexicographic ordering and uses binary search to return the best match to the query string.
- **[Seam Carving](data_structures_and_computer_algorithms/seam_carving):** Seam carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image's size is reduced one pixel at a time to retain most of the image's key characteristics. It is now a fundamental feature in computer graphic applications such as Adobe Photoshop. This project uses dynamic programming to calculate the dual-gradient energy function to find vertical “seams” and resize the image.

## Introduction to Computer Programming (ESC180)
_Taught by Professor Michael Guerzhoy._ 

The following projects were made in Python.
- **[Credit Card Simulator](/introduction_to_computer_programming/credit_card_simulator):** Simulates credit card transactions to track the balance owed, interest accrued, and partial and complete bill payments. The simulator also implements a flagging algorithm to deactivate the credit card if fraud is suspected.
- **[Gomoku](introduction_to_computer_programming/gomoku):** A simple artificial intelligence (AI) engine for the standard variant of the game [Gomoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku), which is a 2-player game played on a 8 × 8 board.
- **[Semantic Similarity](introduction_to_computer_programming/semantic_similarity):** An intelligent system that picks a word's synonym from a given list of alternatives. The system computes each word's semantic descriptor vector and cosine [semantic similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_similarity) with an accuracy of about 73%.

## Structures and Materials (CIV102)
_Taught by Professor Evan Bentz._ 
- **Beam Bridge Simulator:** A beam bridge simulator that uses geometric properties to calculate a beam bridge's shear forces, loads, stresses, and factors of safety, as well as produce shear force (SFD) and bending moment (BMD) diagrams. Utilized to test bridge resiliency and optimize bridge design.
